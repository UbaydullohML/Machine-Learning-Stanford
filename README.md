# Machine-Learning-Stanford

- Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it

This github provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. 

Topics include: 
(i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
(iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
